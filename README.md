# Home BOT

This is a very simple bot for Telegram that I created just to be able to ask via Telegram which is my IP address.

As I access my Raspberry Pi remotely daily I need to know my IP address to be able to connect via SSH, and as my ISP do
not lock my IP statically (without paying a very expensive tax), every time there is a surge of power or a service maintenance my external IP changes.

This script is always executed on my Raspbian at boot-up and keeps running, and then I'm always able to ask my actual home IP numbers.

I will probably add more functionalities as I see fit, but for now it only tells me my IP.  


### Commands that should be sent as Telegram messages

```ip``` --- bot answers with it's external IP




## api_key.py
A file should be created that contains two important variables.
* TOKEN (this contains the API key Token generated by BotFather on Telegram)
* ID (this holds the chat ID of the bot owner) 

The bot only responds a command with the right output, 
after checking if the chat ID is the one listed on the api_key.py. This makes a simple
but very effective security measure.
